Rails for iOS Developers

Do you have a mobile application on iOS that requires more than basic cloud support?  

Provide your own custom application server API using Ruby on Rails, the most productive and maintainable web server platform available.  Ruby on Rails is fully open source and used for hundreds of thousands of web applications and services worldwide today.  

This course is for you if you are a mobile application developer and any of the following interest you:

 * Providing interaction between mobile users
 * Providing part or all of your application functionality on on the web
 * Improving your SEO (Search Engine Optimization) by providing an integrated marketing web site or blog
 * Aggregating and analyzing activity on your mobile application
 * Providing an API to external applications to allow integration to your mobile solution
 * Replacing your server implementation on a cumbersome, brittle, expensive, and/or proprietary stack such as .NET, Java, or PHP
 * Escaping the limitations of a third-party or proprietary gaming or UI framework
 * Speeding up the initial Ruby on Rails learning curve by spending a weekend in a coding bootcamp
 * Learning from experienced rails developers who have been active on the platform since it was pre 1.0
 
This two day course will take you through building an iOS application including deployment to Heroku, a cloud based Ruby on Rails hosting provider.   We will also include some time to address specific concerns from participants in order to increase the value of the course to your specific needs.

Ruby (A multi-purpose scripting language developed in the 1990s)

We will briefly cover the most important aspects of the Ruby language.

 * Syntax and structure (comments, command separation, "require")
 * Ruby's OO paradigm (classes, duck typing, mix-ins, etc.)
 * Ruby's dynamic features (metaprogramming, introspection)
 * Important items not commonly found in other languages (symbols, closures)
 * Ruby's culture (use of idiom, terseness, DRY, trust)

Rails (A web application framework developed in the 2000s using the Ruby language)

Ruby on Rails is a comprehensive and mature platform for developing web applications and services.  It is built on an interpretation of the Model-View-Controller pattern, which if followed, allows for robust and very maintainable code.  We will introduce the following core Rails topics as the class builds a rails solution:

 * Rubygems and the bundler
 * Models
   * Data access (ActiveRecord)
   * Migrations
 * Controllers
   * Providing web page access
   * REST-style APIs
 * Views
   * Administration interfaces using the scaffold
 * Routing

Pitch 1

You've got your iPhone app almost ready to go, but now you need a website. You're an iOS developer, not a web developer, and every day that goes by is another day that your app ISN'T in the App Store. You can outsource your server-side development, but that costs both time & money.  What if you could build your own website? Our Rails for iOS Developers Workshop will help you get your responsive website up and running, using the powerful Ruby on Rails framework, from creation to deployment, in straight-forward, easy to follow steps.

Pitch 2

You've got your iOS app almost ready to go, but now you need to supply data updates without re-releasing the app every time.  You need a server-based data source, but you're an iOS developer, not a web developer. Where do you start?  We've seen the problems that iOS developers experience, when diving into server side development for the first time and we can help with our Rails for iOS Developers Workshop.  Ruby on Rails is a powerful framework, but you don't need it all. We've got you covered, with a workshop that delivers Ruby on Rails (the good parts) that you need to get your app out the door. 

Pitch 3

Your iPhone app is almost ready to go, you just need to add a communication channel between app users. You need a server-side API to facilitate.  How do you do that, anyway?  Ruby on Rails seems like the answer to your problems, but iOS developers also need additional tools and gems that the average Rails developer knows nothing about. Our Rails for iOS Developers Workshop covers those tools, with working examples, building a working server for a real iOS app, with code for both client and server sides.  We'll help you get that app out the door.

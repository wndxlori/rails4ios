=========

Course outline

 2 days (15 hours)
 
 Ruby - 2 - 3 hours
 Rails / iOS - 10 - 11 hours
 Ad hoc / open - 1 - 2 hours

   

TODOs

 * Finalize course outline
 * Build demo app, using iOS and Rails on Heroku
 * Find a location

THINGS TO EXPLORE

 * RestKit
 * NS Rails
 * AF networking

PAIN POINTS

 * Web!
 * Design!


MARKETING

 * bigger picture: ebooks, screencasts
 * What do they need?
  * API, data storage/feed only?, blog?, collaboration/interaction?, aggregation?
  * More than just a storage backend API--want to have more control and flexibility
  (for course--perhaps have a space limit for field trips where the app would show how many seats left?)

Rails for iOS Developers

Do you have a mobile application on iOS that requires more than basic cloud support?  

Provide your own custom application server API using Ruby on Rails, the most productive and maintainable web server platform available.  Ruby on Rails is fully open source and used for hundreds of thousands of web applications and services worldwide today.  

This course is for you if you are a mobile application developer and any of the following interest you:

 * Providing interaction between mobile users
 * Providing part or all of your application functionality on on the web
 * Improving your SEO (Search Engine Optimization) by providing an integrated marketing web site or blog
 * Aggregating and analyzing activity on your mobile application
 * Providing an API to external applications to allow integration to your mobile solution
 * Replacing your server implementation on a cumbersome, brittle, expensive, and/or proprietary stack such as .NET, Java, or PHP
 * Escaping the limitations of a third-party or proprietary gaming or UI framework
 * Speeding up the initial Ruby on Rails learning curve by spending a weekend in a coding bootcamp
 * Learning from experienced rails developers who have been active on the platform since it was pre 1.0
 
This two day course will take you through building an iOS application including deployment to Heroku, a cloud based Ruby on Rails hosting provider.   We will also include some time to address specific concerns from participants in order to increase the value of the course to your specific needs.
